# 🌊 **One Piece RPG Discord Bot**

> A living roleplay & adventure system where players create their own pirate, marine, revolutionary, or wanderer and carve out a destiny across the seas.

---

---

### **B. Origin & Faction**

The **island of origin** sets your **starting questline** and **default alignment**. Later, players can betray or switch allegiances, but beginnings shape the first impression.

---

### **C. Initial Dream (Character’s Goal)**

Dreams replace a **traditional class system**. They are **long-term aspirations** that grant **early perks** and expand into **unique skill trees**.

---

# ⚓ **Crew & Ally System + Ship Mechanics**

---

## 2. **Crew System (Player Guilds / Parties)**

Crews are the **heart of a One Piece RPG bot**. They’re more than parties — they’re **shared identities**, complete with ships, flags, and reputations.

### **A. Forming a Crew**

* **Requirement:** Captain must have completed their “First Voyage” questline (earning a ship).
* **Command Example:** `/crew create <name>`
* **Customization:**

  * Crew Name
  * Crew Flag (pick from preset icons, unlock custom with quests)
  * Motto (short text that appears in battles/explorations)

### **B. Crew Roles**

Each role gives a **buff** to the crew, encouraging teamwork.

* **Captain:** Decides direction, sets quests, gives +5% morale (attack buff).
* **First Mate:** Assists captain, bonus to leadership rolls, keeps crew stable.
* **Cook:** Provides buffs via `/cook` meals.
* **Navigator:** Reduces travel cooldowns, finds safe routes.
* **Doctor:** Can heal allies after fights, reduces death penalty timers.
* **Shipwright:** Repairs ships faster, can upgrade ship mechanics.
* **Musician:** Boosts morale with unique buffs (e.g., Brook-style).
* **Fighter(s):** General crew members (brawlers, snipers, swordsmen).

### **C. Crew Progression**

* **Crew Bounty (Infamy):** Increases as crew completes raids, attacks Marines, or steals treasure.
* **Crew Reputation:** Distinguishes whether they’re known for *honor, chaos, or cruelty*.
* **Crew Perks:** Unlockable at milestones (crew size, bounty level, or big victories).

  * Example: At 50 million bounty → unlock *Intimidation aura* (weaker enemies flee at start of fight).

---

## 3. **Ally System (Rooster of Canon Characters)**

Ally system = your “support roster,” like One Piece Legends mobile games. Allies are **canonical characters** you earn through quests, storylines, or gacha-style rolls.

### **A. How Allies Work**

* Players can recruit **NPC allies** to temporarily join their adventures.
* Allies grant **passive buffs** and can be **summoned in combat** once per fight.
* Stronger allies = harder quests to unlock.

### **B. Examples of Ally Recruitment**

* **Zoro (Early)** – “The Wandering Swordsman” questline in Shells Town. Buff: +5% sword attack dmg.
* **Nami (Early)** – Complete navigation quests in Syrup Village. Buff: +5% gold from loot.
* **Chopper (Mid)** – Medical support ally from Drum Island questline. Buff: heal after battle.
* **Ace (Special Event)** – Unlock through Marineford event chain. Summon attack: “Fire Fist.”
* **Sabo (Revolutionary path)** – Unlock after siding with Revolutionaries. Buff: +10% XP gain in rebel quests.

### **C. Ally Limits**

* **Active Roster:** 3 at a time.
* **Storage Roster:** Unlimited (like a “gallery” of unlocked allies).
* **Bond Levels:** Improve ally bonuses by completing missions with them.

---

## 4. **Ship Mechanics**

Ships aren’t just transport; they’re **moving bases** for the crew. They scale with the crew’s size, power, and ambitions.

### **A. Ship Types (Tiers)**

1. **Small Boats (1–2 players)** – Rowboats, dinghies. No cannons.
2. **Medium Ships (Crew of 5+)** – Caravels, sloops. 1–2 cannon slots.
3. **Large Ships (Crew of 10+)** – Galleons, brigantines. 4+ cannon slots.
4. **Unique Ships (Quest Unlocks)** – e.g., *Going Merry*, *Thousand Sunny*, or custom builds.

### **B. Ship Stats**

* **Durability (HP)** – How much damage the ship can take.
* **Speed** – Travel cooldown reduction.
* **Cargo Space** – How many resources/treasures can be stored.
* **Firepower** – How many cannons/weapon systems.

### **C. Customization**

* **Figureheads** (boost morale, intimidation, or speed).
* **Sails** (different colors/patterns affect recognition).
* **Cabins** (Doctor’s Room = faster healing, Kitchen = better cooking buffs).
* **Jolly Roger** (crew symbol, boosts intimidation/fame).

### **D. Ship Combat (Crew vs Crew or Crew vs NPC)**

* **Command Example:** `/ship battle <crew>`
* Turns alternate between *crew maneuvers* and *ship cannons*.
* Crew members can “board enemy ship” mid-combat for melee fights.
* Winning grants bounty + resources, losing risks losing cargo or damage costs.

---

## 5. **Combined System Flow**

1. Player creates character (Race + Origin + Dream).
2. Gains **starter quests**, earns first small boat.
3. Unlocks **crew creation** after first voyage.
4. Recruits **allies** from canon storylines.
5. Expands crew → upgrades ship → enters bigger seas.
6. Endgame: **Server-wide events** (Marineford War, Enies Lobby Raid, Yonko Battles).

---

# 🚢 **Ship Upgrade Trees**

Ships evolve as your **crew grows stronger**. Instead of just being bigger, upgrades give **branching choices**, letting captains decide if they want a **fast raider, a heavy warship, or a versatile explorer**.

---

## **A. Base Ship Progression**

Every crew starts with a **Small Boat** → upgrades into **Customizable Ships** as milestones are reached.

* **Tier 1 – Dinghy / Rowboat (solo or 1–2 players)**

  * Tiny, fragile, but enough to get started.
  * No cannons, no storage.

* **Tier 2 – Caravel / Sloop (crew of 3+)**

  * First “real” ship, small cabin space, 1 cannon slot.
  * Unlocks customization tree.

* **Tier 3 – Brigantine / Medium Galleon (crew of 6+)**

  * Larger ship, multiple cabins, 2–3 cannon slots.
  * Branching specialization begins here.

* **Tier 4 – Grand Vessel (crew of 10+)**

  * Full crew warship, flagship potential.
  * 4–6 cannon slots, multiple upgrades unlocked.

* **Tier 5 – Legendary Ship (endgame unlock)**

  * Either a **unique quest ship** (*Going Merry*, *Thousand Sunny*) OR a fully customized build.
  * Unlocks all special ship mechanics.

---

---

### 🎭 **5. Hybrid / Legendary Path – Endgame Customization**

At Tier 5, crews can **combine elements** from multiple trees or unlock unique ships.

* **Hybrid Builds:**

  * Example: **Fast Warship** (Speed + Warship) → Cannons + Escape options.

---

## **C. Crew Ship Management**

* **Shipwright Role** is vital → needed to unlock/repair upgrades.
* **Resource Costs:** Wood, metal, rare seashells, treasure.
* **Faction Discounts:** Marines/Revolutionaries get bonuses on warships, Pirates on speed/cargo, Neutral crews on explorers.

---

## **D. Ship Events**

Ships also trigger **server events** when upgraded:

* Warship Tier 4 → crew bounty skyrockets → Marines/Revolutionaries actively hunt them.
* Explorer Tier 4 → chance to discover server-wide events (Sky Islands, Raftel clues).
* Cargo Tier 4 → crew becomes target of pirate NPC raids.

---

🔑 In short:

* **Speed Ships** = hit-and-run, explorers, bounty hunters.
* **Warships** = PvP monsters, faction warfare.
* **Cargo Ships** = treasure hoarders, economy builders.
* **Explorer Ships** = lore-driven adventurers.
* **Legendary/Hybrids** = ultimate crew-defining endgame vessels.

---

---

# ⚔️ Crew vs Crew (CvC) PvP Mechanics

## **1. Battle Setup**

* **Command**: `/pvp challenge @crewname`

* **Arena Options**:

  * **High Seas** (open ocean battle, focuses on Ship + Cannon mechanics).
  * **Island Raid** (crew fights on land, focused on crew members + allies).
  * **Mixed Battle** (ship vs ship until one side boards the other; combines both).

* **Party Slots**:

  * Each crew selects **up to 6 active members** (players + their allies).
  * Ship is treated as a “7th slot” with HP, upgrades, and cannon damage.
  * Substitute system: benched members can swap in mid-battle at cost of 1 turn.

---

## **2. Turn Structure (Semi-Tactical)**

PvP is **turn-based**, because real-time combat is hard to manage in Discord.

* **Initiative**: Random roll + Ship’s “Sailing” stat influences order.
* **Actions per turn**:

  * Attack (basic or skill-based).
  * Special Move (DF ability, Haki, Weapon Art, Ally Unique Skill).
  * Ship Action (cannon barrage, evasive maneuver, boarding action).
  * Support (heal, buff, rally).

---

## **3. Ship Role in PvP**

Ships aren’t just background—they define the **combat terrain**.

* **HP & Armor**: If Ship HP hits 0, crew automatically loses.
* **Upgrade Effects** (from your Ship Tree):

  * **Hull Plating**: Reduces all incoming cannon damage by % value.
  * **Sails Upgrade**: Crew attacks have +Speed bonus (higher initiative).
  * **Special Modules**: Unique moves (Flame Cannon, Reinforced Ramming, etc.).

---

## **4. Crew & Ally Combat Roles**

Each crew slot fills a role (similar to RPG party balance).

* **Striker (Damage Dealer)**: Zoro, Sanji-type allies.
* **Support (Buff/Healer)**: Chopper, Kaya, Revolutionary Doctors.
* **Tactician (Debuff/Control)**: Usopp, Nami (weather, illusions, traps).
* **Tank/Defender**: Marine soldiers, strong NPC allies, armored characters.
* **Wild Card (Unique)**: Devil Fruit or dream-specific roles (e.g., Cook buffs food mid-battle, Cartographer reads enemy tactics).

---

## **5. PvP Rewards**

* **Bounty Increase**: Winners gain Bounty across crew (loss also may slightly raise notoriety).
* **Loot**: Small chance of stealing resources (berries, timber, cannonballs).
* **Ranked Rewards**: If ranked ladder is enabled, monthly rewards (titles, rare mats, cosmetic Jolly Roger upgrades).
* **Prestige**: Crew “Notoriety” leaderboard that changes server status (your crew might be called “Terrors of the East Blue”).

---

## **6. Balance Mechanics**

* **Tier Restrictions**: Crews can’t bring multiple “S-tier” allies like Zoro + Sanji + Smoker at once. Limit: 1 S-tier, 2 A-tier, rest B/C.
* **Stamina System**: Crew members and allies have limited stamina per PvP week. Prevents spam-farming.
* **Ship Balance**: Even if one crew has stronger members, weaker crew with stronger ship upgrades can still win.

---

## **7. Advanced Modes**

* **Crew Brawl (3v3)**: Smaller skirmishes for quick battles.
* **Fleet Wars** (future Grand Line expansion): Multiple crews ally and fight in large-scale wars with raid-like mechanics.
* **Territory Control**: PvP that decides control of Islands (dock taxes, resource multipliers).

---

# 🏝️ East Blue Islands & Territories

Each island is both a **story hub** (for MSQ/Ally recruitment) and a **strategic territory** (for crew control, resources, PvP).

---

## **1. Dawn Island (Foosha Village)**

* **Narrative Role**: Starting area (tutorial hub). Players spawn here or nearby based on origin.
* **Territory Bonus**: Basic resources (wood, food). Small XP boost for low-level players.
* **Control Feature**: Mostly symbolic — crews can plant their **first Jolly Roger** here (your "home port").

---

## **2. Shells Town**

* **Narrative Role**: Marine hub (Captain Morgan arc). MSQ for Marine origin players.
* **Territory Bonus**: Access to **Marine training grounds** (combat stat boosts, recruit basic Marine NPC allies).
* **Control Feature**:

  * Marines = natural defenders.
  * Pirates/Revs must raid it to weaken Marine presence (PvP event).

---

## **3. Orange Town**

* **Narrative Role**: Buggy’s domain. MSQ includes first DF-user fight.
* **Territory Bonus**:

  * “Circus Loot” → Berries & Trinkets (sellable resources).
  * Shops offer **cheap cannonballs** (early naval advantage).
* **Control Feature**:

  * Whoever controls Orange Town can set **trade taxes** (5–15% cut of all shop purchases).
  * Boosts crew income.

---

## **4. Syrup Village**

* **Narrative Role**: Usopp + Black Cat Pirates. Ship acquisition quests.
* **Territory Bonus**: **Shipyard Access** → Cheaper ship upgrades and repairs.
* **Control Feature**:

  * Controlling Syrup lets your crew build ships faster.
  * Other crews pay a fee for repairs unless allied.

---

## **5. Baratie (Floating Restaurant)**

* **Narrative Role**: Sanji arc, Krieg Pirates confrontation.
* **Territory Bonus**: **Food Buffs** → Crew meals give PvP/PvE buffs (HP regen, ATK up, DEF up).
* **Control Feature**:

  * Controlling crews set the **menu price**.
  * Neutral option: leave it open for all (gain passive “reputation” instead of tax).

---

## **6. Arlong Park (Cocoyashi Village)**

* **Narrative Role**: Arlong’s reign of terror. MSQ moral dilemma.
* **Territory Bonus**:

  * Control over **Fish-Man Resources** (rare corals, exotic fish = crafting mats).
  * **Combat Training Buffs** if your crew allies with freed villagers.
* **Control Feature**:

  * If Marines/Revs liberate, they gain **moral prestige** (reputation boost).
  * If Pirates control, they gain **tribute tax** (villagers pay weekly).

---

## **7. Loguetown** (Final Island in East Blue)

* **Narrative Role**: Bridge to Grand Line (Smoker, execution platform).
* **Territory Bonus**:

  * Access to **Grand Line Charts** (unlocking next saga).
  * **Bounty Board Hub** (PvP rankings visible here).
* **Control Feature**:

  * No single crew can hold Loguetown forever → it’s a **Contested Zone** (weekly crew battles decide control).
  * Winner gains **server-wide fame** (title: “Rulers of Loguetown”).

---

# ⚔️ Territory Control Mechanics

1. **Capturing an Island**

   * Crew challenges current holders → PvP event or PvE raid vs NPC defenders.
   * Requires planting **Jolly Roger** at Dock/Town Square.

2. **Maintaining Control**

   * Weekly upkeep → crew must defend vs NPC raids or rival crews.
   * If upkeep fails, territory becomes **Contested** again.

3. **Benefits of Control**

   * Economic: taxes, trade boosts, discounts on upgrades.
   * Social: reputation titles, special NPC allies.
   * Combat: buffs when fighting on “your” island.

4. **Faction Influence**

   * **Pirates** → Tax villages, extort resources.
   * **Marines** → Establish “Justice HQs,” reduce pirate presence.
   * **Revolutionaries** → Free islands, inspire rebellion (gain hidden support).
   * **Neutral** → Maintain balance, gain rep without forcing taxes.

---

# 🗺️ Suggested Flow for East Blue Control

* Crews start with **Dawn Island (Foosha)** → symbolic base.
* Move outward: Shells/Orange/Syrup/Baratie → “mid-tier” territories.
* Arlong Park = first **major contested territory**.
* Loguetown = endgame hub, rotating control via **weekly wars**.

---

# ⚔️ **Faction Quests System**

Faction quests differ from MSQ in three key ways:

1. **Repeatable / Procedural** → Keeps gameplay loop engaging beyond main arcs.
2. **Reputation-Oriented** → Completing them raises faction rep and unlocks unique gear, perks, or allies.
3. **Dynamic Goals** → Change depending on player progression, island control, and PvP events.

---

## 🟦 **Marine Faction Quests** (Justice & Order)

Marines focus on maintaining order and suppressing pirate/Revolutionary influence.

**Quest Examples**:

# 🚢 Crew-Wide Reputation Benefits

## 🔑 Core Principles

3. **Crew Perks** unlock at milestones of **Crew Rep**, just like individuals do.
4. **Discord Integration** → Crew perks = unlocked via slash commands (/crew\.perks, /crew\.stats), and buff effects can show as role tags or automated messages.

# 📜 Crew Contracts System

## 🔑 Core Principles

1. **Player-Driven Economy** → Crews generate jobs, not just the bot.
2. **Faction Influence** → Contracts can help or sabotage faction reputation.
3. **Discord Integration** → Jobs show up as bot posts in a **Contract Board Channel**, managed by commands.
4. **Risk vs Reward** → High-paying contracts often involve PvP risk or reputation consequences.

---

## ⚙️ Workflow: How Contracts Work

1. **Posting a Contract**

   * Command: `/crew.contract.post`
   * Options:

     * **Type** (Escort / Trade / Raid / Liberation / Exploration / Hunt / Spy)
     * **Reward** (Berries, Resources, Item, or Reputation)
     * **Target/Objective** (Island, Crew, NPC)
     * **Difficulty** (Ranked Easy → Legendary)
   * Cost: Small upfront posting fee (prevents spam).
   * Bot posts an embed in **#contracts-board** with all details.

2. **Accepting a Contract**

   * Command: `/crew.contract.accept [contractID]`
   * Crew locks in as contractor.
   * Contract moves from “Available” → “In Progress”.
   * Bot announces in #contract-updates (like a bounty board).

3. **Completion/Failure**

   * Upon success:

     * Contractor crew receives reward.
     * Posting crew reputation + resources adjust accordingly.
     * Bot posts a summary event in **#world-news**.
   * Upon failure (timeout or loss):

     * Contractor loses rep/resources.
     * Posting crew may recover partial deposit.
     * Rival crews may “steal” the contract by intercepting.

## 🏴‍☠️ Discord Integration

* **Channels**
- Allow Administrator only to decide where these channels goes. Do not auto create it. Let administrator do it manually:
  * `#contracts-board` → Bot posts active contracts (embed style).
  * `#contract-updates` → Tracks ongoing contracts.
  * `#world-news` → Bot posts summaries of completed/failed contracts → creates living story.

* **Embeds Example**

```
📜 New Contract Posted!
Crew: Bloodfang Pirates  
Type: Raid Contract  
Target: Shells Town (Marine Outpost)  
Difficulty: Hard ⚔️  
Reward: 5000 Berries + +200 Pirate Rep  
Expires: 48 hours  

💰 Use /crew.contract.accept 21 to accept.
```

* **Auto Announcements**

  * Success → “The Bloodfang Pirates successfully raided Shells Town, plundering Marine supplies!”
  * Failure → “The escort crew was ambushed! The Marines reclaimed their stolen cargo.”

---

## 🔥 Crew-Wide Tie-ins

* **Faction Synergy** → Some contracts give **crew rep boosts** that apply to Crew Perks progression.
* **Economy** → Completed contracts generate **passive crew income** if trade routes are secured.
* **PvP Hooks** → Rival crews can ambush contracts mid-progress.

---

## 📈 Progression & Scaling

* **Contract Rank** (E → SS) → Determines difficulty, PvP risk, and reward tier.
* **Crew Reputation Rank** → Higher rank = ability to post more lucrative contracts.
* **Cooldowns** → A crew can post **1 major contract per day**, but accept multiple smaller ones.
